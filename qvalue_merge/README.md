## Qvalue Merge

Repo for the `spectromerg` shiny app developed for Monash Proteomics and Metabolomics Facility.

### Inputs
- Qvalue 
- Qvalue Sparse matrix generated by Spectronaut.

The shiny app will create a csv file by merging above two files and replace Qvalue protein intensities with binary `TRUE & FALSE ` values and add suffix `_imputed` to each Qvalue intensity column header. 

Additionally, a column `num_NA` summarises number of missing values per row based on Qvalue matrix.
